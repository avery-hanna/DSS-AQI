Work flow:
1. git pull: updates your local code with any changes that have been added
2. git checkout -b your-branch-name: make a new branch named your-branch-name. Takes you to that branch
3. git checkout your-branch-name: takes you to a branch that has already been made
4. git add . : adds all the changes you have made so you can commit them
5. git commit -m "your message here": commits your changes logging the updates you've made on your branch. Still local
6. git push: updates the github with the changes you committed. Now everyone can see the work you did on your branch
