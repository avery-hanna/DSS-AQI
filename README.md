Using Git:

set up:
1. Clone repo to your computer so you'll be able to work locally: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Work flow:
3. git pull: updates your local code with any changes that have been added
4. git checkout -b your-branch-name: make a new branch named your-branch-name. Takes you to that branch
5. git checkout your-branch-name: takes you to a branch that has already been made
6. git add . : adds all the changes you have made so you can commit them
7. git commit -m "your message here": commits your changes logging the updates you've made on your branch. Still local
8. git push: updates the github with the changes you committed. Now everyone can see the work you did on your branch
